# Multimodal-ML-Housing-Price-Prediction-Using-Images-Tabular-Data
This project aims to predict housing prices by leveraging both structured tabular features (like square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, year built) and visual information from house images. Combining these two modalities allows the model to capture richer information about properties, improving prediction accuracy.
